<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I am a computational physicist and I spend most of the day in front of a computer. I consider myself quite the lazy person, and I find many of the daily tasks that are associated with my job to be extremely boring and repetitive. During the course of the years I have developed my own way of dealing with these chores.</p>
<p>These notes contain many tricks of the trade I routinely use during my everyday job to make my life easier and, which is of the outmost importance for me, less boring. I am sure many of the solutions I have found to cope with these common issues can be solved in multiple ways. I am equally sure that many of the solutions I overlooked are plain better than the paths I chose to take. If you find that this is the case, feel free to drop me a line at <script type="text/javascript">

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book">How to use this book</h2>
<p>The book is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and translated to HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>be-lazy.md</code> and <code>be-lazy.html</code> files contain the entirety of the book in Markdown and HTML format, respectively.</p>
<p>If you want to change the content of the book just edit one or more chapter files and then, if you have Bash and Pandoc installed on your system (and the Pandoc executable is in your path) compile the book from the source by running the <code>compile.sh</code> script. This will generate the <code>be-lazy.md</code>, <code>be-lazy.html</code> and <code>README.md</code> files.</p>
<p>This is not a book to be read in one take. On the contrary, it should be considered as a collection of tips &amp; tricks to be referred to when the need arises.</p>
<p>I plan to add as many figures and examples as possible. These will be included in the source of the book.</p>

<h1 id="bash">Bash</h1>
<p>In the following I will assume that Bash is the default <a href="#shell">shell</a> of your system and that you know how to start a new terminal, which usually boils down to writing &quot;terminal&quot; in your OS' search bar and starting up the first search result.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> is probably the most common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">Unix shell</a>. It is the default login shells of many LInux distributions, as well as of Apple's Mac OS X. For our purposes, Bash is the command line through which we communicate with and operate on the files and directories stored on the <a href="#filesystem">filesystem</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> <code>man COMMAND</code> will show the manual associated to <code>COMMAND</code>, listing all the supported command-line arguments, the most common use-cases and some examples. Use the <code>man</code> command as often as possible, and <strong>never</strong> use a command without knowing what it does.</p>
<h2 id="commands-and-programs">Commands and programs</h2>
<p>There are two types of shell commands: builtins and programs (there are also Bash <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-8.html">functions</a>, which behaves similarly to builtins). The former are a (small) number of commands that are provided by the shell out of the box. The ones I use the most are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alias</code> and <code>unalias</code> (see <a href="#aliases">Aliases</a>)</li>
<li><code>echo</code>, which outputs its arguments and is often used to generate the input consumed by another program (see <a href="#piping">Piping</a>)</li>
<li><code>read</code>, which can be used to parse input lines by splitting them up into words and assigning them to shell variables</li>
</ul>
<p>The great majority of commands one uses are external programs. Many of the main (and most used) external programs are shipped in nearly every <a href="#unix-like">*nix</a> distribution. Indeed, commands such as <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code>, <em>etc.</em> are always available. However keep in mind that, while the bulk of their features is standard (either truly or <em>de facto</em>), their options differ from platform to platform. For instance, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a> provides some handy extensions that are not present on Apple systems.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> Many commands (most of the default ones) support combining switches when these are used in their short form. For example, <code>ls -lhS</code> is equivalent to <code>ls -l -h -S</code>.</p>
<h2 id="files-and-directories">Files and directories</h2>
<p>The first task you will likely use the shell for is to browse through the <a href="#filesystem">filesystem</a> to work with files and directories (create, delete, move or edit them, execute programs, <em>etc.</em>). Think of the filesystem as a tree-like structure: leaves are files, branches are directories (and leaf-less branches are empty directories). An example of a part of a filesystem (as output by the <code>tree</code> command), with directories being coloured in blue and files in black is</p>
<pre>
<span style="color:blue">root_directory</span>
├── a_file
├── <span style="color:blue">first_directory</span>
│   ├── <span style="color:blue">another_directory</span>
│   │   └── a_nested_file
│   ├── another_file
│   └── one_more
└── <span style="color:blue">second_directory</span>
</pre>
<p>In <a href="#unix-like">*nix</a> systems, the filesystem tree starts in the directory indicated by <code>/</code>, which is aptly called the <em>root</em> directory. When you open a shell (or a terminal), you will be placed in a starting directory which, most likely, will be your own home directory. By default, its path is <code>/home/your_username</code> (<em>e.g.</em> <code>/home/lorenzo</code>).</p>
<p>You can use the <code>pwd</code> command, which prints to screen the name of the (current) working directory, to find out where you are. The same can be achieved by printing the <code>PWD</code> environment variable (<code>echo $PWD</code>), which Bash sets to the current directory every time the working directory is changed.</p>
<p>You can change the current directory with the <code>cd</code> command. If you want to move to the <code>other_dir</code> directory just type <code>cd other_dir</code>. <code>cd</code> accepts both absolute and relative paths.</p>
<h3 id="cd"><code>cd</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>cd ..</code> move to the parent of the current working directory</li>
<li><code>cd -</code> move back to the previous working directory</li>
<li><code>cd</code> or <code>cd ~</code> move to your home directory</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ls"><code>ls</code></h3>
<p><code>ls</code> is very powerful. Its output can be finely tuned by using the appropriate switches. Here are some of the switches (and switch combinations) I find most useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls -lrth</code> show the entries in a long listing format (<code>-l</code>) with their size in human-readable form (<code>-h</code>) and sorted by reverse (<code>-r</code>) modification time (<code>-t</code>).</li>
<li><code>ls -S</code> sort the entries by size (from large to small). Use <code>-r</code> to reverse the sorting</li>
<li><code>ls -1</code> list one entry per line</li>
<li><code>ls -d</code> list the directories themselves, not their content. File entries are not affected</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="executable-files"><del>Executable files</del></h3>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Similarly to any other programming language, Bash supports variables. However, Bash does not have data types, meaning that variables can contain integers, floating point numbers, strings, single characters, <em>etc.</em> Compared to more modern programming language, Bash variables feel somewhat quirky. However, they get the job done reasonably well. As an example, the following box contains a &quot;Hello World!&quot; example that makes use of variables:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
TO_PRINT=&quot;Hello World!&quot;
echo $TO_PRINT</code></pre>
<p>There are several things that are worth noting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first line contains the so-called *shebang&quot;. A shebang (the character sequence <code>#!</code>, followed by a command) is used by the shell whenever a text file (commonly referred to as a <a href="#script">script</a>) is <a href="#executable-files">executed</a> in order to pass it to the right interpreter. For instance, the first line of a <code>python</code> script should be <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> (or, even better <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code>, as explained <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2007-June/054816.html">here</a>).</li>
<li>The syntax for variable assignment is <code>KEY=VALUE</code>. <strong>NB:</strong> No spaces are allowed around the equal sign.</li>
<li>The <em>value</em> of a variable can be accessed by prepending a <code>$</code> to the variable name .</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> variables need not be declared. In fact, they can be used before even having been set or initialised! This is a common source of bugs, as shown by the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
TO_PRINT=&quot;Hello World!&quot;
echo $TO_PRNIT</code></pre>
<p>The misspelt name of the variable will not cause any warnings or errors, and the code will misbehave.</p>
<p>Variables defined with the syntax shown above are dubbed shell or local variables, as they exist only within the shell (or script) in which they are set or defined. The topic of <em>global</em> variables will be touched upon in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="the-bash-environment-and-environment-variables">The Bash environment and environment variables</h2>
<p>The Bash (or, more generally, shell) environment is the set of information that determines the shell behaviour (how it interacts with the user, how it accesses the system's resources, <em>etc.</em>). On a practical level, Bash uses the content of a variety of (global and user) configuration files spread throughout the filesystem to compile a list of key-value pairs: the environment. For each pair, the key is the <em>name</em> of the environment variable which can be used to access its value(s). Traditionally, these variable names are all uppercase. The complete list of environment variables (that is, the whole environment) can be printed with the <code>printenv</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="redirection-and-piping">Redirection and piping</h2>
<p>The main strength of Bash (and of all the other shells) comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>, which can be summarised as <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write programs that do one thing and do it well.</li>
<li>Write programs to work together.</li>
<li>Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the command-line utilities that can be find in a Unix-like environment (such as Linux, BSD, Mac OS X) follow, more or less closely, this philosophy. As a consequence of the wide adoption of the principles listed above, many of said utilities can perform only very specific duties. Moreover, most of the communication to and from these programs is text-based and carried out through their input and output streams. It is therefore very common to split the task at hand in <em>subtasks</em> that are performed by several programs in a serial fashion: each program manipulates an input and pass the resulting output to the next program. The mechanism that makes it possible to forward the output of a program to the input of another program is called <em>piping</em> and is signalled by the presence of the pipe sign, <sub>|</sub>. At the end of this process it is a common patter to <em>redirect</em> the final output to a file.</p>
<h3 id="inputoutput-redirection">Input/output redirection</h3>
<p>There are three standard input/output (I/O or just IO) streams: the standard input, or <code>stdin</code>, the standard output, or <code>stdout</code>, and the standard error, or <code>stderr</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>stdin</code> is used to acquire (possibly interactive) input (see <em>e.g.</em> the <code>scanf()</code> or <code>fscanf(stdin)</code> C functions)</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> is to print the <em>regular</em> output of the program (see <em>e.g.</em> the <code>printf()</code> or <code>fprintf(stdout)</code> C functions)</li>
<li><code>stderr</code> is for printing warnings, diagnostics or error messages (see <em>e.g.</em> the <code>fprintf(stderr)</code> C function)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bash, the default behaviour for programs that expect input is to prompt the user for input. However, the <code>stdin</code> can be redirected by using a <code>&lt;</code> sign. For example, a program <code>my_program</code> that reads from the standard input can be instead fed a file <code>my_input.txt</code> by using <code>my_program &lt; my_input.txt</code>.</p>
<p>For the output streams, the default behaviour is to write them on screen. In order to redirect a output stream to file, use the <code>&gt;</code> sign. For example, <code>echo &quot;Hello beauty!&quot; &gt; msg.txt</code> will put the <code>&quot;Hello beauty&quot;</code> text in the <code>msg.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <code>stderr</code> can be redirected by using the <code>2&gt;</code> token. For example, <code>ls wrong_file 2&gt; error.txt</code> will put an error message (provided there is no file or directory named <code>wrong_file</code> in the current directory 😄) in the <code>error.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>It is possible to redirect <strong>both</strong> <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> streams by using the <code>&amp;&gt;</code> sign.</p>
<p>In general, all the above output redirection signs will write the output of the programs that are on their left-hand side to the files whose name is on their right-hand side, possibly overwriting any previous content. In order to <em>append</em>, rather than write, the output to those files is sufficient to add a <code>&gt;</code> to each token. Thus, <code>&gt;</code> becomes <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>2&gt;</code> becomes <code>2&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;&gt;</code> becomes <code>&amp;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> all multi-character tokens used for redirection should not contain spaces. In other words, be careful: <code>&amp;&gt;</code> and <code>&amp; &gt;</code> are <strong>not</strong> the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="piping">Piping</h3>
<p>If you follow the Unix philosophy, you will often need to feed a program with the output of another program. This is called <em>piping</em> and it is done through the <code>|</code> (pipe) symbol. The pipe tells the shell to redirect the standard output of the command on the left-hand side of the pipe to the standard input of the command which is on the right-hand side of the pipe. For instance, take a directory containing a lot of files and/or folders. Imagine you want to have a look at the contents of the directory. This can be done by piping the output of <code>ls</code> (here complemented by the <code>-1</code> argument which tells <code>ls</code> to list one entry per line) to <code>less</code>, which is used to page through text, in this way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">ls</span> -1 <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">less</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Use the arrow keys or the page-up/page-down buttons to page through the text and <code>q</code> to quit.</p>
<p>Do not be deceived by the simplicity of the above example: the possibility of chaining together different processes is at the core of the Unix philosophy and makes it possible to easily create extremely complicated and powerful <em>pipelines</em> (that is, sequences of processes linked together by <code>|</code>). For instance, the following pipeline uses</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>grep</code> to extract from the <code>prova.dat</code> file only those lines that contain integer numbers</li>
<li><code>sort</code> to numerically sort them</li>
<li><code>tail</code> to take the two largest numbers</li>
<li><code>awk</code> to print the average of these two values</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">grep</span> -E <span class="st">&quot;^[0-9]+$&quot;</span> prova.dat <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">sort</span> -n <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">tail</span> -n 2 <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">awk</span> <span class="st">&#39;{a+=$1; t++} END {print a/t}&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You do not have to understand all the details, but just realise the sheer power of being able to combine the multitude of basic commands that a modern Linux shell provides.</p>
<h2 id="aliases">Aliases</h2>
<p>With Bash it is possible to create shortcuts (aka <em>aliases</em>) for commands which are used often, difficult to remember or both. This can be easily done by using the <code>alias</code> built-in. For example, many versions of the <code>ls</code> command can colorise their output by passing it the <code>--color=auto</code> switch. On many Linux distributions (<em>e.g.</em> Ubuntu), <code>ls</code> is just an alias to <code>ls --color=auto</code>, set with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">alias</span> ls=<span class="st">&#39;ls --color=auto&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I do not use many aliases, but the ones I cannot do without are</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">alias</span> <span class="st">&#39;cp=cp -i&#39;</span>
<span class="kw">alias</span> <span class="st">&#39;mv=mv -i&#39;</span>
<span class="kw">alias</span> <span class="st">&#39;rm=rm -i&#39;</span>
<span class="kw">alias</span> <span class="st">&#39;ll=ls -lh&#39;</span>
<span class="kw">alias</span> <span class="st">&#39;ssh= ssh -Y&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-i</code> in the first three makes them ask the user before overwriting or deleting any files. This makes it harder (but not impossible) to do stupid mistakes. The effect of <code>-i</code> can be counteracated by <code>-f</code>: <code>rm -f .</code> will <em>not</em> ask confirmation to delete all the files in the folder!</p>
<p>The <code>-Y</code> switch passed to <code>ssh</code> enables X11 forwarding. In other words, makes it possible to remotely open applications that have X11-compatible graphical interfaces (<em>e.g.</em> plotting tools).</p>
<p>If called without arguments, <code>alias</code> prints a list of the currently-defined aliases. <code>unalias</code> can be used to remove a previously-set alias. By default, once an alias has been defined, it will live till it is unaliased or the terminal it was defined in is closed. In order to make an alias permanent, put its definition in the <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code> files in your home folder. See <a href="#make-your-changes-permanent-.bashrc">.bashrc</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="exposing-cc-code-to-python-with-boost-python">Exposing c/c++ code to Python with Boost Python</h2>
<p>There are many ways to create dynamic libraries written in c or c++ that can directly imported by Python. Here we will discuss Boost Python. On Ubuntu (and, I suppose, on other Debian-related distros) Boost Python requires the <code>libboost-python-dev</code> package.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> Boost is a collection of very powerful c++ libraries. However, since c++ is (roughly speaking) a subset of c, Boost Python can also be used to create python bindings for code written in c. However, note that the code will have to be compiled with <code>g++</code> (or an equivalent c++ compiler).</p>
<p>Here is a simple example that will generate a dynamic library exposing a class and a function to python. Copy the following code to the &quot;Foo.cpp&quot; file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="ot">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">class</span> Foo {
<span class="kw">public</span>:
    Foo() {

    }
    <span class="kw">virtual</span> ~Foo() {

    }
    <span class="dt">void</span> print_something(std::string something) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; something &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    <span class="dt">void</span> print_special(std::string special) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; <span class="st">&quot;special: &quot;</span> &lt;&lt; special &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
};

<span class="dt">void</span> print_without_class(std::string something) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; something &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(foo) {
    boost::python::class_&lt;Foo&gt;(<span class="st">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>)
            .def(<span class="st">&quot;print_something&quot;</span>, &amp;Foo::print_something);
            
    def(<span class="st">&quot;print_without_class&quot;</span>, print_without_class);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Not all the public interface functions and methods have to be exposed to python. For this specific example, we have decided to export a function and a class with the default constructor and one of its two public methods). Now we build the shared libray. Pay attention to the arguments of the <code>-I</code> and <code>-l</code> options:</p>
<pre><code>g++ -fPIC -I/usr/include/python2.7  -c Foo.cpp -o foo.o
g++ -shared -o foo.so foo.o -lpython2.7 -lboost_python -lboost_system</code></pre>
<p>We have nothing else to do: the library is now freely importable by python:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> foo
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> f <span class="op">=</span> foo.Foo()
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> f.print_something(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>)
Hello, world<span class="op">!</span>
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> foo.print_without_class(<span class="st">&quot;I hate classes!&quot;</span>)
I hate classes<span class="op">!</span>
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> f.print_special(<span class="st">&quot;My special text&quot;</span>)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File <span class="st">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="op">in</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span>module<span class="op">&gt;</span>
<span class="pp">AttributeError</span>: <span class="st">&#39;Foo&#39;</span> <span class="bu">object</span> has no attribute <span class="st">&#39;print_special&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As can be seen from the error above, only the methods, classes and functions that are explicitly mentioned in the exporting function can be accessible from python.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> The name of the python module (which is set by the only argument of the <code>BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE</code> macro) <strong>must</strong> match the name of the library file or python will complain by throwing a <code>ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function</code> exception.</p>
<p>Boost python has a lot of features (for instance, it supports templates, inheritance, <em>etc.</em>). Check out the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/python/doc/html/">documentation</a> for more complex examples and for the reference manual.</p>
<h3 id="speeding-up-compilation-and-reducing-memory-consumption">Speeding-up compilation and reducing memory consumption</h3>
<p>Compilation time and memory footprint of large projects can become an issue. These problems can be mitigated by a simple <em>divide et impera</em> procedure. For instance, take a project containing two classes, <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code>. Each class has its own <code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files. Then, at the end of each <code>.cpp</code> file we put a function that performs the actual exporting. For example, burrowing from the previously-defined <code>Foo</code> class one might have:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="dt">void</span> export_foo() {
    boost::python::class_&lt;Foo&gt;(<span class="st">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>)
            .def(<span class="st">&quot;print_something&quot;</span>, &amp;Foo::print_something);
    <span class="co">/* export here everything that needs to be exported for this compilation unit */</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we round up all these exporting function in a single file <code>mylib.cpp</code> where the actual module-creation is carried out. For the specific case considered here, the content of such a file would be</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="ot">#include &quot;Foo.h&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">#include &quot;Bar.h&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">void</span> export_foo();
<span class="dt">void</span> export_bar();

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(mylib) {
    export_foo();
    export_bar();
}</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="compiling-with-cmake">Compiling with CMake</h3>
<p>Compiling python modules with CMake is straightforward. First of all, we need to find all the packages that are required to correctly compile the module:</p>
<pre><code>FIND_PACKAGE( PythonLibs 2.7 REQUIRED )
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

FIND_PACKAGE( Boost COMPONENTS python REQUIRED )
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR} )</code></pre>
<p>Note that you need to choose the python version you want to create bindings for. Now create a new target, ensuring that is linked against the right libraries (here we assume that the source files are listed in <code>mylib_SOURCES</code>):</p>
<pre><code>ADD_LIBRARY(mylib SHARED ${mylib_SOURCES})
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mylib ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ${PYTHON_LIBRARIES})</code></pre>
<p>And do not forget to ensure that no prefixes are added to the library name, lest python will refuse to import the module:</p>
<pre><code>SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(mylib PROPERTIES PREFIX &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>On Mac Os X, dynamic libraries have extensions &quot;.dylib&quot;. Unfortunately, some python installations do not recognized those as modules. A workaround might be:</p>
<pre><code>IF(APPLE)
    SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(mylib PROPERTIES SUFFIX &quot;.so&quot;)
ENDIF(APPLE)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> if you are using the Boost logging facilities, you will need to declare the <code>BOOST_LOG_DYN_LINK</code> macro or python will complain. This can be done with</p>
<pre><code>ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DBOOST_LOG_DYN_LINK)</code></pre>
<hr />
<h1 id="plotting">Plotting</h1>
<p>There exists a lot of software devoted to the production of scientific (or more in general, data) plots. However, almost every single scientific community has its own preferred tool. The most common in my own community are <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">xmgrace</a>, gnuplot, Mathematica and matplotlib.</p>
<h2 id="xmgrace">xmgrace</h2>
<p>For unknown (but mostly historical, I suppose) reasons, many people in the water/numerical soft matter communities love to use <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">xmgrace</a>. It is ugly, old and supports 2D graphics only, but if your PhD advisor uses it, chances are you will have to get used to it as well 😄</p>
<h3 id="improve-the-default-style">Improve the default style</h3>
<p>There is no other way of putting it: the default xmgrace style sucks. Hard. The great majority of the people who start using it goes through the process of setting up the graph style for every single plot they need to prepare. Fortunately, xmgrace provides an easy way out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take an empty <code>agr</code> file and edit its style to suit your needs.</li>
<li>Name it <code>Default.agr</code> and place it in the <code>~/.grace/templates/</code> folder. Note that it might be necessary to create the folder beforehand.</li>
</ul>
<p>My actual <code>Default.agr</code>, which can be used as a starting point to make your own custom style, is included in the <code>misc</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="change-the-default-colours">Change the default colours</h3>
<p>The default xmgrace colour palette is quite lackluster, to say the least. Luckily, it is very easy to change the default colours. Open your <code>Default.agr</code> (see previous section) and look for the <code>@map color</code> lines. Add any line you want (taking care not to have repeated colour indeces), or change the existing ones. Colours should be specified with the RGB format and are always fully opaque.</p>
<p>Once you are done just save the file and open <code>xmgrace</code>. You will be greeted by a (hopefully) much more colourful palette!</p>
<p>For instance, the following lines (contained in the <code>misc/Default.agr</code> example file)</p>
<pre><code>@map color 0 to (255, 255, 255), &quot;white&quot;
@map color 1 to (0, 0, 0), &quot;black&quot;
@map color 2 to (227,26,28), &quot;red&quot;
@map color 3 to (51,160,44), &quot;green&quot;
@map color 4 to (31,100,180), &quot;blue&quot;
@map color 5 to (255, 127, 0), &quot;orange&quot;
@map color 6 to (106,61,154), &quot;violet&quot;
@map color 7 to (177,89,40), &quot;brown&quot;
@map color 8 to (220, 220, 220), &quot;grey&quot;
@map color 9 to (251,154,153), &quot;light red&quot;
@map color 10 to (178,223,138), &quot;light green&quot;
@map color 11 to (166,206,227), &quot;light blue&quot;
@map color 12 to (253,191,111), &quot;light orange&quot;
@map color 13 to (202,178,214), &quot;lilla&quot;
@map color 14 to (212,184,127), &quot;light brown&quot;
@map color 15 to (139, 0, 0), &quot;red4&quot;
@map color 16 to (0, 139, 0), &quot;green4&quot;
@map color 17 to (0, 0, 139), &quot;blue4&quot;
@map color 18 to (139, 139, 139), &quot;grey4&quot;</code></pre>
<p>generate the colour palette shown below</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/xmgrace_palette.png" alt="The colour palette specified in the /misc/Default.agr" />
<p class="caption">The colour palette specified in the <code>/misc/Default.agr</code></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> the colour palette of old plots (or of plots generated on computers that use a different <code>Default.agr</code>) will not be affected. However, plots generated with your own style will look the same wherever you (or anyone else) will open them!</p>
<h3 id="scripting-xmgrace">Scripting xmgrace</h3>
<p>Scripting xmgrace is not as straightforward nor as powerful as it is for other similar software such as gnuplot. However, together with Bash (or Python or any other scripting language) it can be used to make the automatic generation of plots a bit easier.</p>
<p>We will start with an example. Prepare a plottable datafile and call it <code>my_data.dat</code>. Copy the content of the following box to a file (<code>batch.xmg</code>, for example):</p>
<pre><code>READ NXY &quot;my_data.dat&quot;
PRINT TO &quot;my_data.eps&quot;
DEVICE &quot;EPS&quot; OP &quot;level2&quot;
PRINT</code></pre>
<p>Now call <code>gracebat -batch batch.xmg -nosafe</code>. The <code>gracebat</code> executable is part of xmgrace and it is used when there is no need to start up the GUI. We pass it a simple script that loads up the datafile and tells xmgrace to print it as an eps file using the standard style. Note that we have to include the <code>-nosafe</code> option or xmgrace will refuse to run some commands such as <code>PRINT</code>. Block data can be read by using the appropriate command, for example</p>
<pre><code>READ BLOCK &quot;my_data.dat&quot;
BLOCK xy &quot;1:3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>will create a new <code>xy</code> set with the first and third columns of the datafile.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> You may use batch files that do not explicitly read from any datafile by passing those datafiles directly to the executable, <em>e.g.</em> <code>gracebat -batch batch.xmg -nosafe my_data.dat</code> or <code>gracebat -batch batch.xmg -nosafe -block my_data.dat -bxy 1:3</code>.</p>
<p>The style of the plot can be changed by using the same commands that are found in the <code>.agr</code> files. The best way of learning them is to prepare a plot with the style you want to use, save it and open it with your preferred text editor. You can then straightforwardly copy and paste any line you want to your batch file (omitting the starting `@' sign). For example, with the following box you can set the ranges, labels and ticks of the axes, as well as the style and legend of the first set:</p>
<pre><code>WORLD XMIN 0
WORLD XMAX 25
WORLD YMIN 0
WORLD YMAX 1
xaxis label &quot;x&quot;
xaxis tick major 5
yaxis label &quot;y&quot;
yaxis tick minor ticks 4
s0 line type 0
s0 symbol 1
s0 symbol size 1.5
s0 legend &quot;Experiments&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The full list of commands can be found in the <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/doc/UsersGuide.html#s5">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="ssh">SSH</h1>
<p>Connecting through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> to a remote machine (be it your office computer, home desktop or HPC cluster) is one of the most common operations in the daily routine of many people who do this job. If you are one of these people, you will likely find yourself SSH-ing to this or that computer quite often. If you have an account <code>lorenzo</code> on the <code>powercluster.cool.univ.com</code> machine, you can use the following command to establish a remote connection with it<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> lorenzo@powercluster.cool.univ.com</code></pre></div>
<p>You will then be asked to input your password after which you will be given a shell on the remote machine. Some cautious (paranoid?) sys-admins like to disable the 22 port on which the ssh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemon</a> listens by default. If you try to connect to a remote machine and you receive a <code>Connection refused</code> error, this might be way. In order to connect through another port (port 123456, for instance) use the <code>-p</code> option, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> -p 123456 lorenzo@powercluster.cool.univ.com</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> if you are using <code>scp</code> to copy files from/to a remote machine that accepts SSH connections only through a non-22 port, make sure you add <code>-P port</code> (with a capital <code>P</code>) and not <code>-p port</code> like you would do with <code>ssh</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-wasting-time">How to avoid wasting time</h2>
<p>If you find yourself typing the commands written above over and over, you will quickly realise how annoying it can get, especially if you have multiple computers you often connect to<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. There are two (complementary) ways to save a lot of keystrokes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Set up ssh keys</li>
<li>Set up the list of hosts in the ssh config file</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ssh-keys">SSH keys</h3>
<p>I will not delve into the technicalities of SSH keys because I am not expert and because I do not think this is the right place to have such a discussion. If you are interested you can find many resources online, starting, for instance, from <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/key/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here it suffices to know that you can set up the SSH connection between your local machine and a remote one so that you will not have to enter any password when using it. In order to do so, you will have to first generate an <em>SSH key</em> on your local machine. This can be done with the following command</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh-keygen</span> -t rsa</code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing you will be asked is where to store the key. If you leave the field empty the key will be saved in the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> location, with <code>~</code> being your home directory. You will be then asked twice to enter a passphrase, which can be left empty. There can be security reasons why you would want to enter a non-empty passphrase. However, using a non-empty passphrase would defeat the purpose of this section, as it would make SSH ask for that passphrase every time you want to login on the remote machines you have copied your key to. In the following I will assume you saved the key to the default location and did not enter a passphrase during the key generation.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> the key you have generated is a (sort of) fingerprint of your user on the <em>specific</em> local machine you are generating it on. This means that you have to undergo this procedure once for each computer you connect <em>from</em>, regardless of the number of remote machines you will connect <em>to</em>.</p>
<p>On many systems there exists the <code>ssh-copy-id</code> utility that copies your key over to the right position on the remote machine. If this is your case just call it with the command line options you would use if you were to connect to the remote machine through the usual SSH command. For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh-copy-id</span> lorenzo@powercluster.cool.univ.com</code></pre></div>
<p>or, if you need to use a custom port:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh-copy-id</span> -p 123456 lorenzo@powercluster.cool.univ.com</code></pre></div>
<p>if everything goes smoothly this is the last time you will have to enter your password to connect to that specific remote computer 😄</p>
<p>If your system lacks <code>ssh-copy-id</code> you will have to manually add your public key to the list of <em>authorized keys</em> stored on the remote machine. In order to do so you will have to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>copy your public key, stored in the <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> file (here I am assuming your <code>ssh-keygen</code> was told to put the key in the default location). You should expect it to look like this:</p>
<pre>ssh-rsa GIBBERISH lorenzo@lorenzo-desktop</pre>
where <code>GIBBERISH</code> is a very long string of seemingly random characters and the last token is just <code>your_username@your_host</code></li>
<li><p>establish a connection with the target remote machine and, with your preferred editor, open the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file. Paste your public key on a new line, save and exit</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Et voilà</em>: SSH will not prompt you for the password when accessing this specific remote machine any more!</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> the aforementioned procedure lets you SSH passwordlessly from <code>user_on_A_host@A_host</code> to <code>user_on_B_host@B_host</code>. If you change either the user or the host from which you connect <em>from</em>, you will have to redo the proceudre. If you change either the user or the host you connect <em>to</em> you will have to update the corresponding <code>authorized_keys</code> file by adding the public key you already have.</p>
<h3 id="ssh-config-file">SSH config file</h3>
<p>In this section we will see how to transform this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> -p 123456 lorenzo@powercluster.cool.univ.com</code></pre></div>
<p>Into this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> pc</code></pre></div>
<p>Looks neat, doesn't it? With SSH, just open the file <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (which may not exist yet) and, for each combination of <code>user@host</code> you want to create aliases for, add a few lines that specify the parameters for that specific connection, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Host pc
HostName powercluster.cool.univ.com
User lorenzo
Port 123456</code></pre>
<p>Save and exit. From now on you will be able to use <code>ssh pc</code> in place of <code>ssh -p 123456 lorenzo@powercluster.cool.univ.com</code>: you do not need to reload or restart anything.</p>
<p>A few comments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can omit the <code>User</code> and <code>Port</code> fields if the default values (the current user and port 22, respectively) are fine</li>
<li><p>You can set default values for all or some hosts by using wildcards. For example</p>
<pre>
Host *univ.com
User rovigatti

Host *
User lorenzo
</pre>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> the order with which you list the hosts is very important! SSH parses the <code>config</code> file from the top downwards and uses the <em>first</em> value found for each option whose corresponding <code>Host</code> matches the hostname given on the command line. For instance, in the above listing, inverting the order of the hosts will make SSH always use the username <code>lorenzo</code>, even for hostnames that match the <code>*univ.com</code> pattern.</p></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="escape-sequences">Escape sequences</h2>
<p>OpenSSH provides a variety of escape sequences that can be used during SSH sessions, even when the terminal is unresponsive <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Typing <code>~?</code> (a tilde followed by a question mark) during an SSH session will print the list of available escape sequences which, with my OpenSSH client v7.2, looks like</p>
<pre><code>~.   - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)
~B   - send a BREAK to the remote system
~C   - open a command line
~R   - request rekey
~V/v - decrease/increase verbosity (LogLevel)
~^Z  - suspend ssh
~#   - list forwarded connections
~&amp;   - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate)
~?   - this message
~~   - send the escape character by typing it twice</code></pre>
<p>The most useful escape sequence is undoubtly <code>~.</code> (a tilde followed by a dot), which terminates the connection even when the terminal is unresponsive. This comes in very handy when either your connection or the remote machine's connection goes down and you want to get your terminal back.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> <code>~</code> (the tilde character) should be the <em>very</em> first character on the command line.</p>
